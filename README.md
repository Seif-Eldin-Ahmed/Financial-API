# Financial-API
##
##
### What is this project about:
This project is about a comprehensive financial API, that lets us add and get all the users they join and, their transactions and, reports and, we can apply it to many companies and, institutions.

#
### What languages and tools are used in the project:
- Python
- Django 
- Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- HTML
- CSS

#
### The idea of the project work:
1. We can add a **super user** with special permissions or add a **regular user** from the **_API_** or **_admin_** paths.
2. We can add new categories and financial transactions with specific users and fully control them from the **_API_** or **_admin_** paths.
3. We can control the type of fields that we generate for each user and each transaction.
4. Through the _**API**_ path we can get both:
   - Current transactions
   - Registered users
   - User-specific transactions
   - A Report that contains each user and all the transactions made by him
5. We can also _update_, _delete_, or _post_ a transaction through the _**API**_ and _**admin**_.

#
### What software we used for the testing:
Postman API platform

#
## Risks we faced in the project:
Work on connecting all users from the _admin_ path to the _API_ transactions, collecting user data(_fields_) and all his transactions, and adding them to a report.
